    "### What we have\n",
    "* Genotype data, filted and phased, yet not imputed\n",
    "* RNA-Seq data of gene expression for all sample tissues, available both the counts and RPKM\n",
    "* Sample phenotype / covariates\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we need to do\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Genotype data\n",
    "* We need to impute missing genotypes. We use UMichigen Imputation Panel `minimac3` + HRC reference data\n",
    "* Do some PLINK QC, including\n",
    "    * Keep variants with at least 10 samples having the minor allele (more stringent that 1% MAF filter)\n",
    "* Genotype samples have to match RNA-Seq samples by ID\n",
    "    * Do it to RNA-Seq data when creating HDF5 matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RNA-Seq data\n",
    "* Genes should have at least 10 samples with RPKM > 0.1 and read counts > 6\n",
    "* Use quantile normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Covariates\n",
    "* 3 PCs, gender, genotyping platform, and PEER factors\n",
    "* PEER factors are generated using the top 10000 expressed genes per tissue, after normalization.\n",
    "  * In V6P guideline it seems to vaguely imply using all genes from all tissues. But it seems PEER cannot handle data of that size (too slow to process).\n",
    "  * In [V6 guideline](https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex-public-data/Portal_Analysis_Methods_v6_08182016.pdf) it suggests using top 10K expressed genes per tissue. Since we will remove these covariates via conventional multiple regression anyways it is Ok to correct for it this way.\n",
    "* Number of PEER depends on sample size N. \n",
    "  * $N < 150$, use 15 PEERs, $150 \\le N < 250$, use 30 PEERs, $N \\ge 250$ use 35 PEERs\n",
    "* Regress out these factors separately for each tissue, save the residual to HDF5 as the Y for later analysis\n",
