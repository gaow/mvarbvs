# Codes for benchmark

For this project we would mostly use Python or R codes.

My convention to name code files are:

- `lib_*.py` and `lib_*.R`: means these files are a collection of utilities to support some tasks. They do not work as standalone scripts.
- `misc.py` and `misc.R`: are collections of utilities of more generic uses.
- `*.py` and `*.R`: should ideally be named after their corresponding DSC modules, or module groups, though not necessarily in complete agreement.
